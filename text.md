This program labled as in file "convert.cpp" takes a double value and converts the value into string values throught the .hpp file that I have set up as well. 
The header file would take the user input and initiate the function doubleToString and return the result of such for the main output to call back to. After all 
that the main function will then call on the function with the prototype and converts the double from the user input.
